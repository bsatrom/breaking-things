BreakingThings.io is the personal and semi-professional blog of [Brandon Satrom](/author/brandon). 

An aspiring and self-described maker, Brandon typically writes about the topics capturing his interest and consuming too much of his time, from software & microcontrollers, to CNC milling & prototyping hardware. Pretty much anything and everything Brandon uncovers on his journey to break things in the process of creating something new.
